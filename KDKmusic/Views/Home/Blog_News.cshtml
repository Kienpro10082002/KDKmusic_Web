                Girl group NewJeans’ 2022 single “Ditto” has stayed atop Melon’s daily chart for 77 consecutive days since its release, a record length for any song to stay at the top of the Melon chart, the girl group’s agency ADOR announced Tuesday.

                “Ditto” has also kept its No. 1 position on Melon’s weekly chart for eleven weeks since the release of the song on Dec. 19, another all time record for the weekly chart since it began in 2004.

                NewJeans’ other releases are also standing strong on music charts, with its latest lead track “OMG” (2023) and “Hype Boy” (2022) following at No. 2 and No. 3 on Melon.

                Girl group NewJeans, with members Minju, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein, debuted in 2021 under HYBE’s new label ADOR led by the former creative director of SM Entertainment, Min Hee-jin. NewJeans stormed the global K-pop scene with successive hits, such as “Attention,” “Hybe Boy,” “Ditto” and “OMG.” The girl group received Rookie of the Year awards on multiple award ceremonies and received the Performance of the Year award from the Asia Artist Awards in December 2022.

                Charlie Puth has dropped a new single, “Light Switch.” The upbeat pop song, which sees Puth crooning about his attraction to a love interest, was produced by Puth and co-written with longtime collaborator JKash and Jake Torrey. Listen here.
                You turn me on like a light switch,” Puth sings over a pulsating beat. “When you’re moving your body around and around/I don’t want to fight this. Puth documented the making of the song on TikTok for several months ahead of its release.
                On the songwriting level, it was really cool to share this song with the fans while I made it,” the singer noted in a statement, “So they felt like they were involved at the very beginning of the song, like they almost wrote it with me.
                Light Switch” is the first new song to be released from Puth’s upcoming album, Charlie, out later this year via Atlantic Records. The LP marks the singer’s first full-length release since the Grammy-nominated Voicenotes in 2018.
                The 30-year-old said Charlie is his most personal album to date. “I’ve never had a chance to put out music that is truly me and every song on this album is my personality with some melody attached to it,” he confirmed.
                Last fall, Puth teamed up with Elton John for “After All,” from John’s album of collaborations,&nbsp;The Lockdown Sessions. John and Puth met at a Los Angeles restaurant in early March 2020 and soon discovered they lived near each other. They began collaborating at the start of the pandemic, and “After All” was the first song either artist completed during lockdown.&nbsp;
